#PrettifyParser
Parses Objective-C code copied & pasted from Xcode into a Google-Code-Prettify ready HTML format, retaining all the colours that Xcode uses to make it look nice.
Please feel free to use this code for yourselves! DO IT!

###NOTE
- This code does not work if Google-Code-Prettify is initialised :( I will possibly work on a fix for this in the future.
